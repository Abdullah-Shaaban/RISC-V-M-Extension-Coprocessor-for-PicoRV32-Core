# Implementation of the RISC-V M Extension as a Coprocessor for the PicoRV32 RISC-V Core 
This Coprocessor implements RISC-V M-Extension. It interfaces with the PicorRV32 core using its Pico Co-Processor Interface (PCPI).  
It also contains custom instructions optimized for C-code of Number-Theoretic Transform algorithm. These custom instructions are:
+ Multiply-Remainder
+ Add-Remainder
+ Subtract-Remainder
